            description: "Antigone written Sophocles and directed by Julie Szwedo: In the aftermath of a civil war in which the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynieces, kill each other, the new king, Creon, tries to punish Polynieces for his disloyalty by not burying him properly. Antigone, the girl who will rise up alone and die young, decides to take fate into her own hands by directly disobeying Creon's law. The show will be done in the style of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet with traditional classical language and modern music and setting. Antigone Character Breakdown: Eteocles (Male, 25-35) is the brother of Antigone, Ismene and Polyneices. He took control of Thebes after King Oedipus died, but then refused share the throne with his brother Polyneices. The two brothers fought and killed each other outside one of the city's seven gates - and that's when the real trouble began. Polyneices (Male, 25-35) is the brother of Antigone, Ismene and Eteocles. His name means 'many troubles', and he's generally remembered as 'the bad brother', because he attacked Thebes with a foreign army. While Eteocles was buried with full ritual honours, Polyneices was left as carrion for the crows, in punishment for the vile crime of assaulting his own city. Eurydice (Female, able to play 45+) is the wife of Creon (no relation to the other mythical Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus). She appears right at the end of the play Antigone, in profoundly wretched circumstances. Rehearsal and Audition Info: Rehearsals will be split between Olympia Park Field House in Edison Park, 60631 and second space TBA as needed. Schedule will be based around actor availability, looking at Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays with a possible other weekday added as showtime approaches. ALL ACTORS MUST BE VACCINATED. Compensation will be share of profits split between cast and crew.",
